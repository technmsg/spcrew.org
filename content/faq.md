# Frequently Asked Questions

Things we're asked all the time...

## Auditorium

**How big is the auditorium?**

Per Anne Arundel County Fire Marshall, the auditorium has rated fire capacity of 1,012 persons.

**Are the speakers in the back working?**

The _delay speakers_ in the back ARE working, but their sound output will be almost indistinguishable from sound from the other house speakers. That's by design.

See [Sound Delay Explained](http://www.sxsevents.co.uk/about/resource-hub/explanatory-articles/sound-delay-explained) for more information.

**Can you dim or disable the under seat aisle lights?**

No, the aisle lights remain lit 24/7 for safety reasons. We have no control over them.

## Capabilities

**What sort of media formats can you work with?**

See [playback formats](playback.html).

**Do you have Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters?**

No. If you need to play media from a "new" iPhone you'll need to provide [the adapter](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter). In some cases we may be able to play directly from your iPhone using a dock adapter.

## Internet

**Why is there no cell service?**

The building's construction is responsible for a significant degree of radio frequency interference, so much so that most cell phones don't work within the auditorium (or the rest of the building).

There are pockets of reception around the auditorium, but they're fleeting and unreliable. For better cellular reception, you'll have to step outside.

**Is there WiFi available?**

For teachers using AACPS devices, yes. Otherwise, no.

**What about the Guest WiFi?**

We don't have the credentials.
