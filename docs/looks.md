# Lighting Looks

We have four colors configured to light our cyclorama.

For staffed events, we can mix any number of those across the stage, blend to make other colors, lighten colors, etc. We also have several preprogrammed looks available during staffed events, so feel free to ask for them by name.

Two quick notes:

* Upstage lighting will significantly wash out cyc coloring
* Lighting gels are a perishable resource and lighten over time, so exact colors can't be guaranteed

Consider a backlit entrance for more pop!
