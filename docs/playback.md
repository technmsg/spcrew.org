# Playback Formats

The playback formats we support on various devices. Should your format not be listed, [contact us](contact.html). Usually if you provide a device capable of playing your media we can figure out how to integrate it.

## Console

We can play the following audio formats from a USB drive:

* WAV or FLAC files at 44.1 or 48 kHz

Supported file systems are FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. Size limits are as follows:

* FAT12 = 255MB

Important: The USB drive must use a FAT16, FAT32, or NTFS file system.

## CD Player

We can play the following audio formats:

* CD-DA: 44.1kHz, 16bit, Stereo
* MP2: 32/44.1/48kHz, 32 to 384kbps (data CD)
* MP3: 32/44.1/48kHz, 32 to 320kbps, VBR (data CD)
* WAV: 8/16/32/11.025/22.05/44.1/12/24/48kHz, 8/16bit (data CD)

Music CDs that are commercially available and CD-R and CD-RW discs that have been recorded as audio CD format can be played. These types of discs are called "audio CDs."

We can play back CD-ROM/R/RW discs with MP3, MP2 and WAV files in ISO 9660 Level 1, Level 2 and Joliet formats. These types of discs are called, "data CDs."

We cannot read CD-R/RW discs that have not been finalized.

MP3 and MP2 files are identified by their ".mp3" and ".mp2" file extensions. We cannot play MP3/MP2
files that do not have the correct ".mp3" and ".mp2" file extension, so always include these file extensions at the ends of MP3/MP2 file names.

The unit identifies WAV files with the ".wav" file extension. This unit cannot play WAV files that do not have the ".wav" file extension, so always include the ".wav" file extension at the end of the name of an WAV file.

Data CDs with more than 999 files or 512 folders might not play correctly.
