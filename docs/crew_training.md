# Crew Training

Our student crew receives on the job training as needed, but we try to instill some of the basics throughout the year.

## Basic Training for Crew

1. If you open it, CLOSE IT.
2. If you turn it on, TURN IT OFF.
3. If you unlock it, LOCK IT.
4. If you break it, FIX IT.
5. If you can't fix it, CALL SOMEONE WHO CAN.
6. If you borrow it, RETURN IT.
7. If you use it, TAKE CARE OF IT
8. If you make a mess, CLEAN IT UP.
9. If you move it, PUT IT BACK.
10. If it belongs to someone else, GET PERMISSION TO USE IT.
11. If you don't know how to operate it, READ THE DIRECTIONS or DON'T MESS WITH IT.
12. If it doesn't concern you, DON'T MESS WITH IT.

Originally penned by Miriam Hamilton Keare as _Golden Rules for Living_, modified ever so slightly.

## Read the Stinking Manual

We've collected [documentation and manuals](resources.html) for some of the equipment we use throughout the year. We encourage students to read up on the components that they're responsible for; in some cases training videos are available online.

## Film Education

The advisors are prone to making references to the films of Mel Brooks and Monty Python. That's all we'll say about that.
