# Frequently Asked Questions

Things we're asked all the time...

## Club

**My student interested in tech crew, is it too late to sign up?**

We accept new applicants in the fall, usually the first two weeks of the school year. [Our application](https://spcrew.org/app/) will indicate whether we're accepting new applicants.

If we're full, you can [apply to our waitlist/overflow group](https://spcrew.org/overflow/). Should we have a student drop and/or need additional help with special projects, we'll pull from this group.

**When does tech crew meet?**

Tech crew is a bit different than most clubs in that we don't have a weekly meeting.

We meet to prepare for and support events that require our help year-round -- including weeknights, weekends, and even through the summer -- so [our schedule](calendar.html) varies depending on the event calendar.

Note: The drama department is one of the primary organizations we support so there's a bunch of crossover in personnel and times, but our calendars are very different.

**My student is involved in a fall sport or extracurricular activity. Will they be able to participate in Tech Crew for winter and spring productions? or are they out for the entire year?**

We don't exclude students from a production solely because they opted to participate in other extracurricular activities, but the less we see of them the harder it is to observe how they engage with others, learn the necessary production skills, and most importantly balance the time commitment with family and school obligations.

Larger productions offer a more structured experience for a large group of students but are a significant time commitment. We support several dozen smaller events throughout the school year and each affords learning opportunities for a smaller group. All of our techs can volunteer to support events as their schedule and interest permits. These smaller events may be less flashy, but they're an excellent way to demonstrate interest and learn production skills.

We have had students in the past manage numerous extracurricular activities in addition to tech: sports, band, clubs, scouting, etc. Sometimes that means stepping back from fall or spring productions to focus on other interests. Sometimes that means taking on a more limited role, i.e. helping out with the construction phase but forgoing a position on the running crew. Sometimes that means focusing on smaller evening events. Each student's path depends on their unique desires, level of interest, and their ability to balance various commitments.

## Auditorium

**How do I book the auditorium?**

Scheduling must be confirmed with the Business Manager.

After scheduling, technical needs should be provided on our request form: [spcrew.org/request](https://spcrew.org/request)

**How big is the auditorium?**

Per Anne Arundel County Fire Marshal, the [certified capacity of the auditorium](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/31193324428/) is 1,012 persons. This accounts for the 1,009 seats plus three operators at front of house.

The [certified capacity of the stage](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/44156653475/) is 113 persons.

**Are the speakers in the back working?**

The _delay speakers_ in the back ARE working, but their sound output will be almost indistinguishable from sound from the other house speakers. That's by design.

See [Sound Delay Explained](http://www.sxsevents.co.uk/about/resource-hub/explanatory-articles/sound-delay-explained) for more information.

**Can you dim or disable the under seat aisle lights?**

No, the aisle lights remain lit 24/7 for safety reasons. We have no control over them.

## Capabilities

**What sort of media formats can you work with?**

See [playback formats](playback.html).

**Do you have Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters?**

No. If you need to play media from a "new" iPhone you'll need to provide [the adapter](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter). In some cases we may be able to play directly from your iPhone using a dock adapter.

## Internet

**Why is there no cell service?**

The building's construction is responsible for a significant degree of radio frequency interference, so much so that most cell phones don't work within the auditorium (or the rest of the building).

There are pockets of reception around the auditorium, but they're fleeting and unreliable. For better cellular reception, you'll have to step outside.

**Is there WiFi available?**

For teachers using AACPS devices, yes. Otherwise, no.

**What about the Guest WiFi?**

We don't have the credentials.
