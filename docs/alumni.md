# Alumni

We have a long tradition of former SPHS students that return to assist, passing down what they've learned in tech, school, and industry to current students and advisors alike.

Alumni can join the [crew alumni](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crew-alumni) list on Google Groups. If you don't have a Gmail account, [contact us](contact.html) to sign up.

## Manifesto

A brief statement of intentions for SPHS Tech Crew alumni and volunteers, circa 2012.
 
Alumni should:

* cater to the learning of students, through hands-on instruction and guidance
* avoid taking over projects that could be completed by students
* enlist the help of students (rather than other alumni) to complete tasks
* communicate with other alumni with regard to high level plans to prevent stepping on toes
* attempt to display a somewhat uniform front to students, especially with regard to safety
* remove ourselves from the process and let the students take the wheel, particularly during performances
* provide guidance with regard to safety as far as how the fixtures are physically mounted/hung, but otherwise allow students to design the sound/lighting plots and program the equipment
* make their level of commitment known, regardless of the resulting availability
