Welcome!

Whether you call it stage crew, tech crew, crew, or tech, we're those folks at [Severna Park High School](http://www.severnaparkhigh.org/) dressed in black working behind the scenes.

The student crew provides [production support](productions.html) for school assemblies, concerts, meetings, and theatrical productions within the auditorium and around the school. The crew is responsible for set design, construction, and decoration, as well as the design and operation of lighting and sound systems.

Our web site might be simple and plain, but what we do is anything but.
