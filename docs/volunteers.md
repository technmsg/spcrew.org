# SP Tech Crew Volunteers

We love it when our SPHS alumni come back to help us. We also love it when our tech crew parents help us out.
 
Effective immediately, all crew volunteers must:

1. Submit to a [chaperone/volunteer background investigation](https://www.aacps.org/Page/1869). Don't worry, it's a very quick form to fill out.
2. View the 11 minute [Sexual Harassment and Child Abuse](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL63heeIfctOufz7O6AA0ByiSv1ctT8IAx) training on YouTube (also linked [here](https://www.aacps.org/Page/2460)).
3. Submit the [volunteer training verification form](https://www.severnaparkhigh.org/pdf/Volunteer_Video_verification_form.pdf) (PDF) to Mrs. Dearborn in the Main Office or via email: cdearborn@aacps.org.
 
These requirements apply to all volunteers who are no longer high school students, including adults and parents. There is no cost for the Commercial Background Check; the Fingerprint Supported Background Check is not required for tech volunteers. Approved background investigations are generally valid for two years, so if you've already done that part just watch the video and submit the verification form.

Feel free to [contact us](contact.html) if you have questions.
