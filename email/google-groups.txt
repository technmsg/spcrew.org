Hello,

We attempted to add/invite you to our Google Group, but your Google account has that privilege disabled.

To fix in the short term, see the instructions about managing your global settings here:

https://support.google.com/groups/answer/9792489

You’ll need to go to Add/Invite settings and allow group owners and managers to invite you to join their group.

Once that’s done, let us know, we’ll resend the invite, and once you’ve joined you can go back in and revert the add/invite settings to be more restrictive.

Thanks!
