Subject: Academic eligibility for <event>

<student>

We've been notified that you aren't academically eligible to participate in extracurricular activities, to include tech crew and RNR.

Academic Eligibility is a County-wide requirement for all students so we don't have much leeway, however in the past we've seen students marked ineligible due to grading delays. 

If you believe you ARE indeed eligible or have extenuating circumstances, please work with your guidance counselor to sort things out. If it's a clerical matter or correctable thing, they'll let us know and we can re-add you to our roster.
