As the parent or guardian of a student involved with SPHS Tech Crew, we cordially invite you to join our crew-parents mailing list. 

Subscription is completely voluntary but is the best way to keep abreast of tech events and to communicate with other parents. You can expect about a dozen emails from this mailing list each year, mostly during our fall and spring show season.

We hope you'll join us.
